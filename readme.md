# References vs copying

Today was about cloning stuff, and I probably should do lessons like this after morning coffee as it was hard to make it stick.  I got some things, but then he got a little deep and I got lost.  So I'm flagging this to rewatch when I'm doing with the JS 30/30

## TIL

* use of LET
* learning clone (sorta, I was lost)
